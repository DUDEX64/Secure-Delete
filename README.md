This program will delete files so that none of their remaining content 
can be found on the disk, which prevents file recovery. This is good 
for those who require deleting files so that their sensitive data cannot 
be found though file system analisis.
  
  
**DISCLAMER**: On some systems, like Windows&reg; for example, they may 
automatically make back-ups of the file in case it is accidently 
deleted. This program cannot protect your privacy in this situation.
